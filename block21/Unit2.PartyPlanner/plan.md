1.
Set up the HTML structure:
Create an HTML file (e.g., index.html) and include the necessary HTML elements for the party list, party form, and any other required components.
Add an unordered list (<ul>) with an id of "party-list" to display the party information.
Add a form (<form>) with an id of "party-form" to allow users to create new parties. Include input fields for name, date, time, location, and description.

2.
Style the application:
Create a CSS file (e.g., style.css) and add styles to make the application visually appealing.
Apply styles to the party list, party items, and form elements.

3.
Fetch and display parties:
In the JavaScript file (e.g., script.js), define the API URL for fetching parties.
Create an empty array to store the fetched parties.
Implement the fetchParties() function to make a GET request to the API and fetch the party data.
Parse the JSON response and update the parties array.
Call the renderParties() function to display the fetched parties in the HTML.
In the renderParties() function, clear the party list and iterate over the parties array to create and append list items for each party.
Add event listeners to the delete buttons to handle party deletion.

4.
Create a new party:
In the script.js file, implement the createParty() function to handle form submission.
Prevent the default form submission behavior.
Get the values from the form inputs.
Make a POST request to the API with the party data.
Parse the JSON response and check if the party was created successfully.
If successful, call the fetchParties() function to update the party list.
Reset the form inputs.

5.
Delete a party:
In the script.js file, implement the deleteParty() function to handle delete button clicks.
Get the party ID from the button's data attribute.
Make a DELETE request to the API with the party ID.
Parse the JSON response and check if the party was deleted successfully.
If successful, call the fetchParties() function to update the party list.

6.
Initialize the application:
In the script.js file, add an event listener to the party form's submit event to call the createParty() function.
Call the fetchParties() function to fetch and display the initial party list.
